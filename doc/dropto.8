.Sh NAME 
.Nm dropto 
.Nd Run a program as an unprivileged user
.Sh SYNOPSIS 
.Nm dropto 
.Ar USER
.Ar PROG
.Op ARGS ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION 
.Nm dropto
runs
.Ar PROG
with
.Ar ARGS
as
.Ar USER .
Unlike
.Xr setuidgid 8
from daemontools,
the resulting process is a member of 
.Ar USER Ap
s supplementary groups.

It normally only makes sense to run
.Nm dropto
as root.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT 
The environment is passed through unaltered to the resulting process.
.Sh EXIT STATUS 
.Nm dropto
will exit 100 if there was a usage error.  It will
exit 111 if it encounters any other error.

If
.Nm dropto
manages to exec 
.Ar PROG ,
the exit status of the process will
be the exit status of 
.Ar PROG .
Note that 
.Ar PROG
may also exit with code
100 or 111, so inspection of the process's return code is not sufficient to
tell whether any error occurred in 
.Nm dropto
or in 
.Ar PROG .
.Sh EXAMPLES 
# dropto nobody id
